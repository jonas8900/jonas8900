# Welcome to my coding journey: Exploring, Learning and Creating! 	ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring web developer, 

and there are 

## two things I absolutely love:

1. music 
2. computergames.


#### However, 

something that constantly occupies my mind, which I don't particularly enjoy, is my Type 1 diabetes. 




The lack of sufficient apps and resources for managing it is precisely what I'm working on changing. Every day, I strive to improve the situation by developing helpful tools and solutions. Join me on my journey as I combine my passions for web development, music, and creating a positive impact in the world of diabetes management. 

_That's why I want to use my expertise to help improve or create the interfaces of such apps._
