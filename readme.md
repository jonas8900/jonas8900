# Thank you for visiting	ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring web developer, 

and there are 

## two things I absolutely love: :people_hugging:

1. coding :computer:
2. music	:notes:
<br>

### However, 


something that constantly occupies my mind, which I don't particularly enjoy, is my **type 1 diabetes**.<br><br>

 

The lack of sufficient applications and resources to address this problem is exactly what I am trying to change. 
<br>Every day I strive to improve the situation by developing helpful tools and solutions. 
<br><br>
